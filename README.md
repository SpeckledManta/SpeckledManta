## Hi I am Erik Stockmann

You can also call me **Manta**

I am currently at Miami University in the Games and Simulation Program. 
I would like to learn about creating video games, creating models/art, and Graphic Design/clothing design.
As a Hobby, I enjoy drawing, running, playing soccer, playing video games.
I am also trying to write a *medeival fantasy* genre book series

I currently have __negative__ expirience in coding XD not really, but I'm starting out.

My favorite Animal is currently a __mantaray__.

This year My goal is to improve at Maya and blender, learn website design/begin coding, and create an ink artwork in a semi-similar style as my Artwork that I used as my profile picture.
